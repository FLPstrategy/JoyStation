# JoyStation

JoyStation measures joy. This static version can be used immediately without installing or paying for anything.

## Runs on Google Analytics
Use the analytics software you're already used to. JoyStation takes advantage of Google Analytics Events. Instead of tracking traffic, how about tracking how people feel?

## Designed with iPad 2 in mind
The iPad 2 had a retail lifespan from 2011â€“2014. JoyStation aims to make those devices useful again by turning them into kiosks. By building a web app, we can continue to iterate the software without the need for publishing a native app for hardware that's no longer supported by the manufacturer.

## Hosted right here on GitHub, or you, or anywhere
JoyStation is a single-page web app. That means that you're always looking at the newest version. Get your hands on an iPad 2 that may be collecting dust, and open the web address. http://rcpl.github.io/JoyStation/ If you're interested in hosting JoyStation yourself, we recommend using a stable release https://github.com/RCPL/JoyStation/releases and contributing.

## Powered by Vue.js
The user interface is incredibly simple, but the technology under the hood is from the future. Vue.js makes the modification of the user interface straight-forward to anyone who knows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but without the hassles.

## The Data is Yours
Richland Library doesn't collect any usage data about you, your users, your customers, or anything. Configuration data
